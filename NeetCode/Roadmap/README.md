# üöÄ NeetCode Roadmap

## üìö Overview

Welcome to the **NeetCode Roadmap** section of my technical interview preparation repository! This section is carefully designed to guide you through a comprehensive **step-by-step approach** for solving common coding interview problems. The roadmap ensures that you **build a strong foundation**, gradually advancing to more complex topics.

Whether you are a beginner or brushing up on your skills, this roadmap will help you stay organized and focused as you tackle **NeetCode's structured topics**.

The roadmap is designed to help you progress systematically, starting with **fundamentals** and moving towards **advanced problem-solving techniques**. Here's a breakdown of the topics:

1. **Arrays & Hashing**  
   Lay the groundwork with problems focusing on arrays and hash tables.
   
2. **Two Pointers**  
   Master problems that require using two indices to traverse a data structure.
   
3. **Sliding Window**  
   Learn techniques to solve problems involving subarrays or substrings efficiently.

4. **Stack**  
   Delve into problems that involve **Last-In-First-Out (LIFO)** structures.

5. **Binary Search**  
   Hone your skills with this efficient algorithm for sorted data.

6. **Linked List**  
   Understand how to navigate and manipulate linked lists.

7. **Trees**  
   Explore the structure and algorithms related to binary and non-binary trees.

8. **Tries**  
   Master prefix trees for string manipulation and search problems.

9. **Heap / Priority Queue**  
   Solve problems requiring optimized retrieval of the smallest/largest elements.

10. **Intervals**  
    Work through problems involving ranges and overlapping intervals.

11. **Greedy Algorithms**  
    Learn to build solutions step-by-step, making locally optimal choices.

12. **Advanced Graphs**  
    Dive deeper into graph algorithms, including traversal and shortest paths.

13. **Backtracking**  
    Tackle recursive problems involving decision trees and permutations.

14. **1-D DP (Dynamic Programming)**  
    Solve problems that involve optimization and overlapping subproblems in 1-D space.

15. **2-D DP**  
    Expand your DP skills to solve problems in 2-D grids or tables.

16. **Bit Manipulation**  
    Work with binary representations to solve efficient problems.

17. **Math & Geometry**  
    Solve problems involving numbers, geometry, and other mathematical concepts.
