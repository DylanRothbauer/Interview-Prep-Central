# Find maximum in an Array
Given a list of N integers, representing height of mountains. Find the height of the tallest mountain.
## Input:
•	First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.  
•	The first line in each testcase contains one integer, N.  
•	The following N lines of each test case each contain one integer: the height of a new mountain.
## Output:
For each testcase, output one line with one integer: the height of the tallest mountain for that test case.
## Constraints
•	1≤T≤10  
•	1≤N≤100000  
•	0 ≤ height of each mountain ≤ 10^9
