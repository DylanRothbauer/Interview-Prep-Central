# Problem statement
You are given two numbers 'a' and 'b' as input.  
You must swap the values of 'a' and 'b'.

## For Example:
### Input: 
'a' = 8, 'b' = 5

### Output:
5 8

## Explanation:
Initially, the value of 'a' and 'b' is 8 and 5, respectively.  

After swapping, the value of 'a' is 5, and the value of 'b' is 8.

## Detailed explanation ( Input/output format, Notes, Images )
### Input format:
The first and only input line contains two integers, 'a' and 'b', represeting the two numbers.  
### Output format:
The first line of output prints the swapped value of 'a' and 'b'.  
**Note**: You do not need to print anything. It has already been taken care of. Just implement the given function.
